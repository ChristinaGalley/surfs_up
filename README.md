## Project Overview
The purpose of this analysis was to provide temperature data for the months of June and December in Oahu, which will help W. Avy determine if the surf and ice cream shop business is sustainable year-round.

- As shown in the data frames above, the maximum temperatures in June and December were 85 degrees F and 83 degrees F respectivley which indicates little fluctuation in high tempertatures throughout the year.
- The minimum temperatures in June and December were 64 degrees F and 56 degrees F respectivley. Low temperatures do get colder in the winter as opposed to the summer time, but not by much.
- The average temperatures in June and December were 75 degrees F and 71 degrees F respectivley with a standard deviation of 3.26 and 3.75 respectivley. Again, on average temperatures are colder in the winter, but not by much.

## Summary
The temperature statistics shows that winter tmeps are on average cooler than summer temps in Oahu, Hawaii, however, not by a significant amount. At first glance this is good news for W. Avy's surf and ice creamn shop. But what this analysis does not take into consideration is the precipitation statistics. To gain more information on this factor, I would propose performing 2 quireies concerning the pecipitaion and weather stations closest to the shop location for optimal accuracy of weather statistics and the possible impact on the shop business.
